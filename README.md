# monetGAN

This program transfers style of paintings onto images. Sample paintings and photos can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started),
though any dataset of paintings and photos of sufficient size can be used.
The code is currently written to run on google colab. Edit cells 2 and 3 to correctly import your images.

To convert images, run the code to build and train generator. Add a final code block that runs the generator on all images and saves images to your desired folder.
